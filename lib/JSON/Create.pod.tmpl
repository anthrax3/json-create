=head1 NAME

JSON::Create - turn a Perl variable into JSON

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use JSON::Create 'create_json';
    my %hash = (a => b, c => d);
    my $json = create_json (\%hash);
    # Now $json contains '{"a":"b","c":"d"}', or similar.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module produces JSON out of Perl

It currently works for the simple cases of strings, nested hashes and
arrays, but it is in very early testing stages.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 create_json

    my $json = create_json (\%hash);

Convert a Perl hash or array into JSON.

=head1 CONVERSIONS

=head2 Scalars

Scalars are converted to strings, JSON integers or JSON floats
depending on what Perl says they contain. 

Bytes of value less than 0x20 are converted into the appropriate JSON
escapes. Currently, no escaping or checking is done for Unicode
bytes.

If the scalar contains a regex then JSON::Create lets Perl convert
that to a string then adds that. The output depends on the Perl
version.

There is no handling whatsoever of the more esoteric Perl scalars such
as code references or glob values at the moment.

Undefined values are mapped to the JSON literal "null".

=head2 Hashes

Associative arrays are converted to JSON objects. The keys are escaped
into JSON. The order of the keys is as they are supplied by Perl.

=head2 Arrays

Arrays are converted to JSON arrays. The order of the array is
identical to the Perl one.

=head2 Code references

Code references throw an error. Please see also
L<https://github.com/benkasminbullock/json-create/issues/3> this
discussion.

=head1 EXPORTS

The module exports nothing except by request. One function,
L</create_json>, is exported on request.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This module is a companion module to the same author's
L<JSON::Parse>. Please see that module's documentation for links to
the JSON standard itself and a summary of the ever-growing list of
JSON modules on CPAN.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Zoffix Znet (ZOFFIX) reported an important bug with undefined values,
and various other issues.

=head1 HISTORY

I started making this module so that, with this and JSON::Parse, I
wouldn't have to ever use any of the existing JSON modules on CPAN
ever again. See also L</SEE ALSO>. The exact time I've spent making
this module is recorded in the file F<timesheet.txt> in the top
directory of the distribution. At the time of version 0.02_01, I've spent
6 hours and 45 minutes working on this.
